The key differences between Berkeley sockets and WebSocket are as follows:

Purpose and Use Case:

Berkeley sockets: They are a low-level API for network communication, providing a general interface for creating and interacting with network sockets. They are commonly used for traditional client-server communication over protocols like TCP/IP and UDP.
WebSocket: It is a higher-level protocol built on top of HTTP that enables bidirectional communication between clients and servers over a single, long-lived connection. WebSockets are commonly used in web applications for real-time data exchange.
Communication Model:

Berkeley sockets: They are based on a traditional client-server model where the client initiates a connection to the server, sends a request, and then waits for a response.
WebSocket: It supports full-duplex communication, allowing both the client and server to send data asynchronously at any time after the initial connection is established. This enables real-time updates and notifications without the overhead of HTTP polling or repeated connections.
Transport Protocol:

Berkeley sockets: They can be used with various transport protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, and others, depending on the specific needs of the application.
WebSocket: It typically operates over TCP, providing a reliable, ordered, and bidirectional communication channel between the client and server.
Handshake and Protocol:

Berkeley sockets: They do not define any specific handshake or protocol beyond the basic socket operations. Developers must implement their own messaging formats and communication protocols.
WebSocket: It defines a standard handshake protocol that occurs over HTTP/HTTPS, followed by an upgrade to the WebSocket protocol. Once the connection is established, data is exchanged using a frame-based protocol defined by the WebSocket specification.
Web Browser Support:

Berkeley sockets: They are not directly supported in web browsers and are typically used in server-side applications or desktop applications.
WebSocket: It is supported by most modern web browsers as part of the HTML5 standard, allowing web applications to establish WebSocket connections directly from the browser to the server.
In summary, Berkeley sockets provide a low-level API for network communication, while WebSocket offers a higher-level protocol specifically designed for real-time, bidirectional communication in web applications.
